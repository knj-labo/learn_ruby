# Polish Ruby Programming

## What is this book about?
The most successful apps become more difficult to maintain over time as the codebase increases in size. Often, the source code reaches a point where a rewrite is required because the application can no longer be effectively maintained. Ruby allows you to enjoy programming by making it as simple as possible to build maintainable and scalable apps. Polished Ruby Programming provides you with recommendations and advice for designing Ruby programs that are easy to maintain in the long-term.
